I’m a quantitative economist and researcher focused on **monetary policy**, **financial market volatility**, and **macro-financial risk**. I use **econometric and machine learning methods** to analyze interest rate dynamics, estimate risk premia, and model liquidity and systemic risk.

My work combines academic rigor with hands-on implementation in **Python**, **R**, **Matlab**, and **C++**.
