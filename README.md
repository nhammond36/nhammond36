Hi! I'm an economist passionate about monetary policy, finance, and international finance.
I try to keep up through UChicago RCC wonderful tech webinars.
I'm midway through a Coursera specialization in deep learning. 
Currently I've done a data dive in all Fed policy, administered rates, and overnight interest rates. 
I want to understand repo and the wild, even fragile way our financial system works. Would love to explore with you!
To quote CME's David Gibbs on broker dealers world, "oh its loads of fun. Until it isnt!"
